    <h2>Why care about wildlife?</h2>
    <p>
        The fact that life has managed to exist up to this point, surviving countless natural disasters
        and changes to atmospheric conditions, is a result of evolution over billions of years. It is the intricate relationship
        between the multitude of diverse species within an ecosystem that allows for life to persist against even the most unlikely odds.
        With more biodiversity, more species will survive disturbances to their ecosystems, allowing for energy pathways
        to remain from producers to apex predators. This ensures the survival of the ecosystem,
        and hence this is called <i>ecosystem resilience.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this essential ability of ecosystems to withstand change is also very vulnerable. Ecosystems are already facing a
        difficult battle for survival due to the worldwide declines in species populations. But when humans drive species to extinction,
        not only does this erase millions of years of evolutionary progress, but it also pushes ecosystems to an even more fragile state, where
        a single disease or adverse weather event could potentially cause the collapse of the entire ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, it is the goal of this website to provide an exhibit of wildlife around KGV, as a way to document the diverse
        collection of life within our environment, and where possible, to share ways to promote the survival of wildlife into the future.
