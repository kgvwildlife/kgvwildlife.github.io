    <h2>How can we support the native birds of Hong Kong?</h2>
    <p>
        - It is generally not recommended to feed common urban birds like sparrows and pigeons in Hong Kong, because it can spread disease, 
        create dependency, and attract rodents. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
- Instead, it is better to plant native Hong Kong flora such as native hibiscus and gardenias which can 
        provide nectar and attract insects that birds eat.

    </p>
    <p>
- Avoid leaving bright lights on at night, as light pollution can disorient birds and increase the 
        number of bird-window collisions.
