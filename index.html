    <h2>Why care about wildlife?</h2>
    <p>
        Life on Earth has survived for billions of years through countless disturbances, from asteroid strikes to ice ages. 
        Its survival depends on biodiversity. Within a healthy ecosystem, multiple species perform similar functions, a principle known as functional redundancy. 
        For example, if a disease eliminates one species of plant, herbivores are not left without food because other plant species are available. 
        Similarly, if one type of pollinator disappears, the ecosystem's plants can still be pollinated by other insects or animals that fulfill the same ecological role. 
        This overlap ensures that critical processes like energy transfer and reproduction continue even when one species is lost, 
        preventing the system from collapsing. This ability of an ecosystem to withstand disturbances and maintain its core functions is known as ecosystem resilience.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this resilience, which took millennia to build, is now dangerously weak.
        Human activities, such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change are driving species to extinction at an unprecedented rate. 
        Each extinction removes key functions and interactions within the ecosystem. As biodiversity declines, the system loses its functional redundancy and its structure weakens, leaving it unable to self-regulate effectively. 
        As such, when humans drive species to extinction, 
        not only does it erase millions of years of evolutionary progress, but it also pushes ecosystems to an even more fragile state, where
        a single disease or adverse weather event could potentially cause the collapse of the entire ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website's goal to provide an exhibit of wildlife around KGV, as a way to document the diverse
        collection of life within our environment, and where possible, share ways to promote the survival of wildlife into the future.
