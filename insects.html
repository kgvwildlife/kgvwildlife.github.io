        <h3>Longhorn beetle</h3>
        <p class="scientific-name"><em>Anoplophora horsfieldii</em></p>
        <p>These beetles are native to Hong Kong, but are considered pests in other parts of the world due to their larvae damaging and tunneling through trees.
            They can occasionally be found in KGV, most commonly during the early summer months. Adult longhorn beetles can grow to a length of 2-4cm.

            <h3>Red cotton stainer</h3>
            <p class="scientific-name"><em>Dysdercus cingulatus</em></p>
            <p>These bugs are not native to Hong Kong, coming from South Asian countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, or Malaysia. 
                They are considered a pest of cotton crops, as they feed on sap found inside the seeds and bolls of cotton plants. They also transmit 
                cotton-staining fungi. Red cotton stainers are often seen infesting cottonwood trees in KGV during the early summer months, 
                when cotton falls and releases seeds for these bugs to feed on. They are easy to spot due to their bright-red colour and length of 1-2cm.

                <p class="scientific-name"><em>Orgyia postica</em></p>
                <p>This caterpillar was found near the KGV piazza. Assuming it is a tussock moth caterpillar, the hairs are not venomous, although they could still puncture the skin if touched, causing an itching sensation or a rash.</p>

                <h3>Long-tailed grass lizard</h3>
                <p class="scientific-name"><em>Takydromus sexlineatus</em></p>
                <p>These lizards are a native species and are considered widespread across Hong Kong, often found in lowland areas with tall grass. They can be identified by their
                 long tail, which can be 2-3 times their body length.

                <h3>Changeable lizard</h3>
                <p class="scientific-name"><em>Calotes versicolor</em></p>
                <p>The changeable lizard is a native species, and can commonly be found in shrublands, grasslands, and tree trunks in rural and urban areas
                    throughout Hong Kong. They have radiating black stripes extending from the eyes, and during the mating season, the males' head changes colour from brown to red and black.

                <h3>Oriental leaf-toed gecko</h3>
                <p class="scientific-name"><em>Hemidactylus bowringii</em></p>
                <p>
                    Geckos are nocturnal, hiding during the day and foraging for insects at night. They are often found on the walls of buildings near sources of light.
                    They also have sticky toe pads for climbing, unlike lizards, and they can vocalise, producing chirps that warn off other males or attract females.

    <h2>How can we support the native insects and reptiles of Hong Kong?</h2>
    <p>
        - Planting native Hong Kong flora can provide food for local bees, butterflies, and other insects. 
    </p>
    <p>
        - The common house geckos seen on walls and ceilings are harmless and are fantastic, natural pest controllers. 
        Avoid using bug sprays that will harm them, but instead, release them into the wild safely using a container, or simply let them be.
    </p>
    <p>
        - When hiking, avoid going off-trail to protect sensitive habitat for lizards and insects.
