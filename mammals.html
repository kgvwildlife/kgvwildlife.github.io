        <h3>Feral cat</h3>
        <p class="scientific-name"><em>Felis catus</em></p>
        <p>Feral cats are not native to Hong Kong, but are descendants of introduced domestic cats. 
            Populations of feral cats have decreased in Hong Kong due to neutering programs and awareness campaigns against pet abandonment.
            Feral cats often suffer from poorer health and welfare compared to owned cats, and can predate on native wildlife such as birds or frogs,
            leading to declining populations.

            <h3>Roof rat</h3>
            <p class="scientific-name"><em>Rattus rattus</em></p>
            <p>The roof rat is a non-native species in Hong Kong. They tend to seek shelter and food in urban areas, inhabiting attics, roof spaces, and trees. 
                They can damage crops and buildings, spread diseases, and can cause fires by chewing electrical wires. To prevent damages due to rodents, openings and gaps
                should be sealed, and food should be stored in airtight containers. Trimming tree branches near buildings can also prevent rats from entering buildings.

    <h2>How can we support the native mammals of Hong Kong?</h2>
    <p>
        - Reducing outdoor lighting and noise at night can help animals find food and avoid predators.
    </p>
    <p>
        - In terms of controlling rodents and pests, advocate for solutions that do not use poison, as poisonous bait can harm native mammals as well as pets. 
    </p>
    <p>
        - Encourage driving slowly near parks and wooded areas to avoid collisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        - Keep pets on a leash in natural spaces.
